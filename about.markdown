Hello! I'm Rao Lalitsingh, a seasoned Machine Learning Engineer based in Ahmedabad, Gujarat, with over 5 years of experience in Deep Learning. My journey in the tech world has been marked by a passion for solving complex problems using cutting-edge AI technologies.

<h3> Professional Experience </h3>
Currently, I am a Senior Machine Learning Engineer at The Growth Co., where I lead a team of interns in pioneering AI development in Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Computer Vision (CV). My notable projects include creating a Call Transcriber using Faster-Whisper and Nvidia NeMo, and developing an Information Retrieval NLP model from scratch.

Previously, at Ishitva Robotic Systems, I created customized applications using darknet and YOLO, developed advanced graphic visualization concepts, and prototyped machine learning applications to determine their viability. My tenure also included tuning systems for performance boosts and exploring new technologies to support machine learning applications.

As a Site Reliability Engineer at Crest Data Systems, I proficiently managed client stacks, executed cloud operations, and handled various infrastructure requests.

<h3>Key Projects</h3>
<b>Plastic Waste Sorting</b>: Developed an automated system for sorting recyclable plastics using advanced AI techniques.

<b>Call Transcriber</b>: Engineered an API with FAST API hosted on AWS EC2, implementing ASR and SD using Faster-Whisper and Nvidia-Nemo models.

<b>GPT from Scratch in PyTorch</b>: Designed a GPT model trained on Christopher Nolanâ€™s Wikipedia pages and IMDb reviews.

<b>Image to Text</b>: Developed an API with FAST API, applying prompt engineering to achieve desired results.

<h3>Skills</h3>
Technical Skills: Python, PyTorch, TensorFlow, NumPy, Pandas, FastAPI, Linux, Git, YOLO, Darknet
Soft Skills: Communication, Critical Thinking, Problem Solving

<h3> Education </h3>
I hold a Bachelor of Engineering in Computer Engineering from SAL College of Engineering, where I was a Grand Finalist in the Smart India Hackathon 2018 and won a Gold Medal in Skits at the Inter-University National Youthfest.

<h3> Extracurricular Activities </h3>
I am an active participant in tech meetups focused on future technologies and have a passion for performing arts, including theatre and improv.

<h3>Leadership </h3>
I am currently leading a team of ML Engineers at The Growth Co., providing innovative solutions by analyzing problem statements. Previously, I led ML projects at Ishitva Robotic Systems, building AI models to sort various plastic materials.

Feel free to explore my projects and connect with me on LinkedIn or GitHub.
